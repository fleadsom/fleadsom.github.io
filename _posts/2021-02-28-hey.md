###### Hi! I'm Fred. What's the point in this site?

Hi! Welcome to my blog. Do you ever find that you're sat with ideas swimming around in your head and you just need to order them? What about when you've just sat through 3-4 hours of designing a complex system or algorithm and you want to keep the designs in your head? I do, and I find that writing things out in prose is a great way to reorder and reproduce the best thoughts from an afternoon.

So I made this site. I hope, as a reader, you get three things:
1. Conversation: reach out to me! I'd love to chat about any lightbulbs that flipped for you reading my content
2. Insight: if you're in a creative industry or looking to get into one, I hope to give some encouragement through experiences I've had to those that face the same problems.
3. Motivation: blogs often make their authors seem superhuman - like a magnet for opportunities... I hope I can explain some of my experiences - successful or unsuccessful - clearly enough that they seem plausible, and others can learn from them.

And what's in it for me?
1. Ordering my thoughts - I want to look back over my blogs and remember thoughts I had at specific moments
2. New connections with other creators! I'd love to meet new people with a taste for stories, ideas and a challenger-mindset
3. A digital personality: I hope that my connections can get to know me a bit through the topics I choose to write about here

So thanks for dropping in! Let's celebrate innovation, start conversations, and keep creating.

Fred
